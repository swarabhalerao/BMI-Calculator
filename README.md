# BMI-Calculator
One of the first apps I made using Flutter.

## About
A simple BMI calculator application created with Flutter using custom-built widgets and a clean UI.

## Working
The app allows users to calculate their body mass index (BMI) by inputting their weight and height. The app then provides a BMI score, which indicates whether the person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
